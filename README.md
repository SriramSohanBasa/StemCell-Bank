# **LifeCord: Empowering Tomorrow with Stem Cell Donation**
 
## **About**
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
With the help of an app we developed, patients with blood cancer can now find a possible stem cell and get the therapy they need from the medical professionals in their network.
 
Through the program's portal, donors and patients can register. The system administrator can also manage a network, oversee businesses inside the network of their choice, and generate login credentials for each business administrator. The doctor will decide what course of action to take based on the patient's consent, donor eligibility, and stem cell availability. There are five enterprises, seven organisations, and ten positions total in the application.

10. **Legal Officer:** After reviewing the decision and receiving a work request for a transplant from the Leukaemia Centre Coordinator, the Legal Officer makes a decision.
